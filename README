C2-chessengine
--------------

This repository contains the code for a simple UCI chess-engine.
I started on it long ago, and returned to it occasionally.
It, doesn't play too well and it's kind of slow.
It has been an interesting task though.

I've tried it connected to the SCID-chessprogram on Ubuntu 20.04.
(Just configure a new engine in SCID pointing out the executable.)
There is also a rudimentary command-line interface.
(Just run the executable from the commandline and enter quit from
the keyboard to try that. The input move syntax is simply e2e4 g1f3 etc
but it accepts for instance Ng1-f3 as well.)
It plays, but doesn't yet work as an analysis engine. The number
of possible commands, from a chess-GUI, which it responds
to is limited.

I normally compile it with gcc (g++) from within Eclipse on Ubuntu.
The only linkage-flag needed seems to be -lpthread,
And I use (among others) the dialect-compiler-flag
-std=c++14 and -o3 in a futile attempt to make it as
fast as Fritz or Stockfish ;-).

The main routine is in C2.cpp

To calculate the best move in a given position I use the
min/max-algorithm with pruning of the "search-tree". No AI.
It only searches about 7 moves ahead, because of performance
issues, but this can be configured.
And when judging the positions in the final search-three nodes it
has a reverance for materialistic concerns, however
control of the center squares, devolopment and casteling etc. also
plays a minor part in the judgement.
It "thinks" until it's ready and ignores time-limits on the clock.
It always comes up with the same move in a given position.
